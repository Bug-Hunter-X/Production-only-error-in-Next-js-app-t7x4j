# Next.js Production-Only Error

This repository demonstrates a Next.js application that throws an error only in the production environment.  The error is not caught by standard error handling, making debugging difficult.

## Bug Description

The `pages/about.js` file contains a conditional statement that throws an error only when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`.  This simulates a situation where a bug only manifests in production.  Standard error handling techniques may not be effective in this scenario.

## Solution

The solution involves adding robust error handling that is specifically designed to handle production errors. This often includes strategies for logging and reporting errors in production to monitoring services. Additional error boundary components can improve user experience by providing fallback content or informative error messages in cases where an unexpected error is thrown.
